# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview

The requirement of this project was to create an earthquake map of data from the past seven days. I was to create 3 different map layers so that the map image would have different map backgrounds. I was also asked to add the fault lines throught the world and include infomation about the magintude and location of each earthquake when each earthquake location was selected. I included filters for the all earth quakes, fault lines, and earthquakes with magnitudes over 4.5.
